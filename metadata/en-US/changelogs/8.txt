## New

* Top Songs in the Artist view now tries to fallback to searching for songs by the artist and sorting by play count/rating if the server doesn't support the getTopSongs endpoint
* Images are now downloaded in the background via the Android DownloadManager and won't be corrupted if the app is closed
  * Note: the cache file structure has been changed, so all images will be erased on update and new images will be downloaded as normal

## Fixed

* Fixed some screens displaying under the status bar on certain devices (#83)
* Fixed occasional pausing after playing a few tracks (#66)
* Fixed repeat mode not being persisted after skipping tracks (#56)
* Search no longer clears the query when going back from the "more" results screen
