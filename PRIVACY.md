# Privacy Policy

Subtracks does not contain advertisements, and does not collect personal data.  I am not interested in advertisements or your personal data at all.  There is no Subtracks server for any data to be sent to, so no information is ever transmitted to me or stored by me outside of your device in any way.

The only data that is stored on your device is information about the music on the servers that you choose to connect to.  Data that is transmitted to those servers is subject to that server's privacy policy, and I do not collect or store it.
